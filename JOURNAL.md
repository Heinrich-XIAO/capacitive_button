I started working on this, got the schematic done, made sure it looked nice, and then started working on the PCB. 
This is when I hit my first major hurdle, the autorouter didn't work well. So, I started fixing the autorouter so that I could actually build my pcb.
I finally finished that, and then I just had to install yalc and get that running so that I could run my latest version of the autorouter.
That worked fine, and then I finsihed the pcb.
